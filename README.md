# Anilist Visualizer

ASP.NET Core application for visualizing AniList users' activities as a timeline chart.

The site isn't hosted anywhere.

There is also a [react version](https://github.com/bigchunguspng/anilist-visualizer-react) to be used with an API from "api" branch.

## Features I'll probably implement 🔩

- [ ] zoomable and scrollable timelines 🔍
- [x] grouping titles by their franchise 📽
- [ ] dark mode 🌙
