# Anilist Visualizer

ASP.NET Core application for visualizing **[AniList](https://anilist.co)** users activities as a timeline chart.

## Description 📃

I made it because AniList doesn't offer such functionality and I wish it did.

The site ~~should~~ may be working now, just check it out:

If it's unreachable, you can just download the app from the [releases](https://github.com/bigchunguspng/anilist-visualizer/releases) section and run it locally.

## Features I'll probably implement 🔩

- [ ] zoomable and scrollable timelines 🔍
- [x] grouping titles by their franchise 📽
- [ ] dark mode 🌙
